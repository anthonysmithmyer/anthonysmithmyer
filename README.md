- **Autopsy** is an open-source tool used to analyze a disk image for a digital forensics investigation.
- **Bulk Extractor** is a tool for kali linux that can be used to create a custom wordlist with a disk image, which can be used to crack passwords, find emails, phone numbers, etc.
- **FTK Imager** is a free tool used to create a bit-for-bit image of a hard drive, USB, CD, and other storage media to be analyzed in an investigation.
- **Kali Linux** is an operating system typically used for digital forensics and penetration testing/ethical hacking. You can run it in a virtual machine like VirtualBox (free) or VMware (paid).
- **Volatility** is a tool used to capture RAM on a computer to be analyzed in an investigation. This is highly important for a real investigation because passwords, private keys, and other useful information could be stored in RAM and lost when the computer is taken by law enforcement to be analyzed.
- **Windows Registry Explorer** is a free tool used to explore registry hives without the risk of messing up the computer.
- **Wireshark** is a network analysis tool used to capture and analyze network traffic.

## Certifications

None so far, but I am hoping to obtain certifications with Magnet Axiom and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH).
